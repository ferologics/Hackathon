- create a sketch mockup

#Welcome to the Hackathon wiki!
-------------------------------

google survey - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H7XW10QdnCPWP0Npu91RAzlIeMs7Pp2_EBWj_d4OMwQ/viewform?usp=send_form

This serves for project notes and visualization

#Objective
T1: Let's you find and track hackathons so you never miss one.

T3: Display all the relevant hackathons to you on map, either around you or global, keep track them so you never miss one, see what hackathons are your friends going to, join them and have fun!


#Audience

Every code geek, nerd and tech related person that wants to get in or already is in the hackathon scene. Virtually anyone but mostly coders, hackathon organizers and sponsors.

**age** - all categories
**interests** - programming, design, ux, social networking, computer science, you get it
**circumstances** - you are new to the city and you want go to the nearest hackathon? you want people to know about your hackathon? sure, you can create/add yours. You want to see what hackathons are your friends going to? just open the app. Can't find a hackathon to go to? easy as that. Are there any other worthwhile hackathons than the one I plan on going to? You don't want to spend hours googling for info? Etc.. I'll add more later


#Experience
What do I want the user to experience?

The ease of finding the nearest and most relevant hackathon(s) and not having to worry about missing it, at the same time getting together with their friends which makes them have more fun and enables them to find teams.

#Technical

* External Services

**APIs** - Mapkit, Parse, Github/FB/Twitter/Linkedin/etc.., Kimono.com, New Relic (maybe), Bond, ConvenienceKit, something with json and probably AFNetworking if there isn't a better framework for it, https://cocoapods.org/pods/ObjectMapper maybe this one, looks great.

* Screens

Map screen - local display of hackathons
Upcoming h. screen - list of hackathons you plan on attending
Profile screen - skills/programming languages
Search screen - find friends
Hackathon info screen
create hackathon screen
login screen
share screen
import friends screen?
search hackathons screen
feedback screen/report bug

some container views and stuff

* View/View Controllers/Classes

map view controller
profile view controller
search view controller 2x most likely
login is going to be in app delegate probably
info view controller


* Data Models
Flowchart of the app, how it works, it's logic

#MVP
Define features, lay out the development plan

* week 3
Focus on getting feedback, define the MVP version of app and start developing

//TODO: google form, compile list of hackathons, learn mapkit, working with json files, plists,


* week 4



* week 5



* week 6



* week 7



* week 8
